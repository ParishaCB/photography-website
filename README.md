# Photography Website 

A basic photography website allowing a user to:
- view current exhibitions 
- register as an artist to showcase their work and also to teach photography classes
- register and pay for classes
- created a separate manager area where the managers could upload info regarding classes, exhibitions, and make payments to artists
